Problem Statements:
1. Using dictionary.txt (or dictionary_min.txt), filter out the words in words.txt (or words_min.txt) that are not present in the dictionary.
2. Frequencies.txt file defines the maximum frequency of each alphabet possible in a word. Filter out all the words from the above result that do not satisfy the given frequencies.
3. Each word has a score assigned to it which is nothing but sum of score of each alphabet of that word. Using scores.txt, find the word with maximum score from the above result.
4. In the game of Scrabble, a blank tile can be used as a jack that represents any alphabet that fits in to make a word. You're given a blank tile that can be used for each word only once. A blank tile can be used in place of an alphabet which exceeds the frequency limit given by frequency.txt. Find all possible words using atmost one blank tile for each word.
5. From the above result, print the word having the greatest length. Also print its score along with it.
